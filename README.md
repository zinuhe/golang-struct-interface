<h1>Structs</h1>
Go's structs are typed collections of fields. They are useful to group data together to form records

Itâ€™s idiomatic to encapsulate new struct creation in constructor functions

Structs are mutable

Ways to declare and use structs<br>
```go
type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}
```

```go
p := person{name: "Sean", age: 50}
```

```go
p := person{"Sean", 50}
```

```go
p := person{name: "jimmy"}
p.age = 42
```

```go
// An '&' prefix yields a pointer to the struct.
fmt.Println(&person{name: "Ann", age: 40})
```

```go
func newPerson(name string) *person {
    p := person{name: name}
    p.age = 42
    return &p
}

p := newPerson("Jon")
```

<h1>Interfaces</h1>

A variable of type interface can hold any value which implements the interface. This property of interfaces is used to achieve polymorphism in Go.
